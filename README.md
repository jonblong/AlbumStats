#VibeCheck

Have you ever wanted to know why Channel Orange sounds so good? Curious as to why Lana del Rey makes you want to cry? Interested in the correlation between listening to DRAM and getting lit? Then boy (or girl) do I have the app for you!

VibeCheck allows you to search for abums and view stats about each song in a way that shows you how the album progresses. Track stats like Happiness, Danceability or BPM from start to finish and see what factors go into making your favorite albums sound the way they do. 

Or don't, because this information is functionally useless! [Enjoy!](https://www.vibecheckapp.com)
